# Goer
Goer is a comprehensive restaurant, place, event &amp; news search and recommendation web system to improve personal experience.

• Based on Apache Tomcat and Microservices Architecture, used Java servlet/REST APIs to fetch restaurant, place, event and news data from Yelp, Here, Ticketmaster & New York Times API respectively and independently.

• Utilized MySQL and MongoDB to store backend data(user, restaurant, place, event & news information and visit history).

• Employed HTML5/CSS3/JS to develop dynamic frontend UI with registration, login/logout functionalities and social sharing buttons to all the top social networks(Google+, Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, Weibo and Reddit).

• Designed Item-based (filter based on the combination of user’s geolocation, visit history and personal preferences) and User-based Collaborative Filtering Algorithms(filter based on the similarity of users computed by MapReduce) to improve customized recommendation.

• Deployed on Amazon EC2 for superior flexibility, reliability and high performance.
